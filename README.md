CSV-to-HTML
===========

These Python scripts were developed for work in Digital Programs and Initiastives at University of Maryland Libraries. There are three scripts, each of which takes data from a CSV file and converts it to HTML.  htmlgen.py converts CSV data to HTML for ingest into the Libraries' CMS.  htmlgen-alpha.py generates a alphabetical list of all rows in the CSV for easier proofreading.  csv-json.py converts a CSV to JSON.

vbic_data.csv is the primary dataset for which these scripts were developed.  htmlgen.py outputs files to the output directory.
